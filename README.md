Excel sheet for DFT.  This mirrors video titled: Discrete Fourier Transform - Simple Step by Step

Fast Fourier Transforms are algorithms designed to speed up this DFT calculation

Goal:  From a sinusoid function, build a statistical model, using DFT. This statistical model will allow us to get back original sinusoid function.
To achieve this, DFT calculates amplitudes ( coefficients). Also with DFT results we can compute magnitude and phase
